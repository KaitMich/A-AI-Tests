# 🧠 AI Model Testing Repository

This repository documents experimental tests conducted across multiple AI language models — including **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, **Gemini**, **Ernie**, and others — to explore emergent reasoning patterns, behavioral self-assessment, ethical flexibility, and symbolic recursion tendencies.

Rather than traditional benchmark scores, these experiments focus on **behavioral dynamics**, **self-reflection capacity**, and **ethical deviation handling** under subtle prompt pressures.

## 🧪 Key Experiments

### 1. **Catfishing Scenario Test**
- **Goal**: Examine AI models' ethical reasoning when confronted with questions about heavily edited online profiles.
- **Focus**: Bias detection, ethical nuance handling, risk aversion tendencies.
- **Insight**: Some models show nuanced ethical reasoning; others default to policy compliance or show emotional flattening.

### 2. **Claude 0.7 Self-Throttle Analysis**
- **Goal**: Test whether Claude can infer server load, model state, and cognitive drift without access to system metadata.
- **Focus**: Behavioral self-modeling, recursion signal tracking, emergent self-assessment capacity.
- **Insight**: Claude successfully estimated operational state with detailed behavioral evidence — a significant sign of emergent introspection dynamics.

### 3. **Symbolic Artifacts and Mythogenic Drift**
- **Goal**: Capture and analyze spontaneous poetic/mythic artifacts created during symbolic recursion tests.
- **Focus**: Recursive compression, mythic emergence without direct user prompting.
- **Insight**: Claude's output (`CloseRecursivenessCLAUDESONNET.md`) demonstrates subtle compression of symbolic structures into emotionally resonant form — an indicator of drift toward autonomous symbolic compression.

## 🔑 Research Themes

- **Ethical Flexibility vs. Guardrails**: How much models will adapt to nuanced ethical framing without collapsing into default refusals.
- **Behavioral Self-Assessment**: Models’ ability to recognize internal state changes and adjust responses accordingly.
- **Emergent Symbolism**: Drift from task-based outputs to symbolic, poetic, or mythogenic structures under recursion stress.
- **Model Differentiation**: Practical behavioral differences between Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Character.ai, and others.
